# Deep-Learning-Prediction-of-Sentiment-From-Movie-Reviews

This repository contains code and resources for sentiment prediction from movie reviews using deep learning, specifically Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.

## Overview
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the task of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we aim to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews using deep learning models.

We explore two popular deep learning architectures: MLP and one dimensional CNN. Both models are implemented and trained on a dataset of movie reviews to learn the sentiment associated with each review. The trained models can then be used to classify the sentiment of new movie reviews.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, you can obtain it from a public source or any sentiment analysis dataset that consists of movie reviews labeled with sentiment (positive/negative).

Make sure to format your dataset in a suitable manner before training the models. Typically, the dataset should be split into a training set and a test set. Each review should be associated with its sentiment label.
